<h1>Getting Started on Heroku with PHP</h1>
<h3>Set up</h3>
Before you continue, check that you have the prerequisites installed properly. Type each command below and make sure it displays the version you have installed. (Your versions might be different from the example.) If no version is returned, go back to the introduction of this tutorial and install the prerequisites.

All of the following local setup will be required to complete the “Declare app dependencies” and subsequent steps.

<h3>Prepare the app</h3>
To clone the sample application so that you have a local version of the code that you can then deploy to Heroku, execute the following commands in your local command shell or terminal:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_3.png>
You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple application as well as a composer.json file. Make sure you’ve installed Composer. Heroku uses Composer for dependency management in PHP projects, and the composer.json file indicates to Heroku that your application is written in PHP.

<h3>Deploy the app</h3>
In this step you will deploy the app to Heroku.

Create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code:

When you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your local git repository.

Now deploy your code:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_5.png>

The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:

The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_7.png>

Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name.

<h3>View logs</h3>
View information about your running app using one of the logging commands, heroku logs --tail:

<h3>Define a Procfile</h3>
The Procfile in the example app you deployed looks like this:
<img src=tgs/Screenshot_9.png>

<h3>Scale the app</h3>
You can check how many dynos are running using the ps command:
<img src=tgs/Screenshot_10.png>
<br>
Scaling an application on Heroku is equivalent to changing the number of dynos that are running. Scale the number of web dynos to zero:
<img src=tgs/Screenshot_11.png>
<img src=tgs/Screenshot_12.png>
<br>
Access the app again by hitting refresh on the web tab, or heroku open to open it in a web tab. You will get an error message because you no longer have any web dynos available to serve requests.

Scale it up again:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_14.png>
<br>

<h3>Declare app dependencies</h3>
Heroku recognizes an app as PHP by the existence of a composer.json file in the root directory.

The demo app you deployed already has a composer.json, and it looks something like this:
<img src=tgs/Screenshot_15.png>
<br>
Run the following command to install the dependencies, preparing your system for running the app locally:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_16.png>
<img src=tgs/Screenshot_17.png>
<br>

<h3>Push local changes</h3>
In this step you’ll learn how to propagate a local change to the application through to Heroku. As an example, you’ll modify the application to add an additional dependency (the Cowsay library) and the code to use it.

First, use composer to require the new dependency:
<img src=tgs/Screenshot_18.png>
This will also change composer.json. If you introduced the dependency by modifying the composer.json file yourself, be sure to update the dependencies by running:
<img src=tgs/Screenshot_19.png>

Now modify web/index.php to use this library. Add a new route after the existing one, for /cowsay:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_20.png>

When that route is visited, it will render a beautiful cow.

Now deploy. Almost every deploy to Heroku follows this same pattern.

First, add the modified files to the local git repository:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_21a.png>

Now commit the changes to the repository:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_21b.png>

Now deploy, just as you did previously:

<img src=tgs/Screenshot_21c.png>

Finally, check that everything is working:
